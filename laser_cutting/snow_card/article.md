# Make on my Outdoor Winter Gear - Snow Study Card & Ice Screw Mesh

While doing outdoor activities, I ran into 2 seperate but small problems. 

1. I lost the protective mesh for my ice screw
2. I was considering getting a snow study card

I realized I could just make these items myself and figured it would be fun. Additionally, I could open source the process for any one with the means to create it themselves or mirror the process for other projects. 

So that is what I did, and is a complete guide & reference on how I did it. 

### Ice Screw Mesh

First, I will start off with the simplier one to make. 

Often, ice screws have this mesh around them to protect the threads and also to protect you. 
I find it is very easy to loose these meshes.

I figured it was easy to just model a flat mesh that I can roll up and attach at the ends to create a cylindrical mesh.
